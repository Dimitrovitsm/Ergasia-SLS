Istructions     

1)All the files should be on the same folder in order of the program to fuction correctly     
2)The program is advised to run on the Netbeans IDE enviroment     
3)When running the program you will be greeted with a message saying if you would like to use the default values that were used to run the simulation or put custom ones of your liking.You would have to answer with a y/n.      
4)If you selected "y" the code will run automatically with no more inputs from the user.If you selected "n" the user is needed to submit 4 parameters so the simulation can run.  

     

Special Notes and Assumptions  
  
1)The timings in the simulation are all in seconds     
2)Every Process needs more than 2 seconds to run   
3)The scheduler can at the same time put and remove a Process   
4)A Process on the blocked queue can be inserted at the main queue and simultaneously be excecuted   
5)One CPU cycle can be done at the same time that the CPU gets a Process tasked
