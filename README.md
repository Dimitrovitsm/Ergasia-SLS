Instructions     

1)All the files should be in the same folder in order of the program to function correctly     
2)The program is advised to run on Netbeans IDE environment     
3)When running the program you will be greeted with a message saying if you would like to use the default values that were used to run the simulation or to put custom ones of your liking.You will have to answer with a y/n.        
4)If you selected "y" the code will run automatically with no more inputs from the user.If you selected "n" the user is asked to submit 4 parameters so the simulation can run.     
5)After all that the simulation runs and outputs the number of processes that were created ,the number of times the I/O was used ,the Average Response time and the Average Turnaround time.    

     

Special Notes and Assumptions  
  
1)The timings in the simulation are all calculated in seconds       
2)Every Process needs more than 2 seconds to run     
3)The scheduler can insert and remove a Process from the  CPU at the same time      
4)A Process on the blocked queue can be inserted in main queue and simultaneously be executed      
5)One CPU cycle can be done at the same time the CPU gets a Process tasked
